Description: This package reads in single trial EEG (currently only ascii-exported preprocessed and trial segmented in Brain Vision Analyzer), computes averages (i.e., ERP's) and stores ERP's from multiple data sets in a data.frame like object, such that statistical analysis (linear model, (M)ANOVA) can be done using the familiar R modeling frame work.
